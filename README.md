I’m Laura, a Front End developer in training with a creative background in 3D, animation, and digital experiences.

I love combining creativity + technology to build meaningful, user-centered interfaces. Currently looking for a Front End internship while finishing my Master in Front End Design & Development.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll try to build it ✨
